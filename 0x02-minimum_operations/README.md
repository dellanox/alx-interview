# 0x02. Minimum Operations Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project is part of an algorithmic challenge where we aim to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve a target number of characters in a file. The file initially contains a single character `H`. The only available operations are:

- **Copy All**: Copies all the characters in the file.
- **Paste**: Pastes the last copied characters.

The objective is to write a function that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

## Requirements
- The code is written in Python 3.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- Code must follow the PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.x).
- All files must be executable.

## Key Concepts
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems to solve it efficiently.
- **Prime Factorization**: Used to break down the target number `n` and calculate the optimal sequence of operations.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Choosing the best local option at each step.
- **Code Optimization**: Writing efficient Python code.

## Function Prototype
```python
def minOperations(n):
    """Calculates the minimum number of operations required to get exactly n H characters."""
    return integer
```

- Returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations.
- If n is impossible to achieve, the function returns 0.
